# Grappling Dungeon Database

Jiujitsu has been a huge part of my life since 2021. I created this project as a way to save Youtube videos of the best instructionals/competition footages, as well as adding notes and searchable keywords for them. This will eventually evolve to be a database of grappling clips that can be very helpful for a practitioner to learn from.
